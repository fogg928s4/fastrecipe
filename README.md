# The Fast Recipe
This is an old school project that aimed at creating a visual website for students who wanted to share fast and easy recipes with others.The project makes use of Bootstrap for several styles as well with some of my own styles created specifically for the project. 

This project is a throwback to my beginnnings in Comp Sci with HTML and CSS. Some fixes have been made from the original 2021 version of this project including a better file structure and fixed links. However, the core ideas and messages have been preserved as a time machine for me.
